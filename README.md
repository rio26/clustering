## Clustering Algorithms
Only SNMF was implemented by me. The other comparison clustering Algorithms are provided by scikit-lib.  

### Spectral clustering

### K-means

### Affinity Propagation
Parameter wasn't adjusted, the result looks horrible.

### Agglomerative Clustering\
Parameter wasn't adjusted, the result looks horrible.

### mean-shift
Parameter wasn't adjusted, the result looks horrible.  (It looks like art tho.)

### symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization
Results are shown separately in the clustering/result/snmf/ file.
This behaves almost the same as kernel k-means.
