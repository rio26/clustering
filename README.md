## Clustering Algorithms
All the clustering Algorithms are called from the scikit-lib.  Only SNMF was implemented by myself.

### Spectral clustering

### K-means

### Affinity Propagation
Parameter wasn't adjusted, the result looks horrible.

### Agglomerative Clustering\
Parameter wasn't adjusted, the result looks horrible.

### mean-shift
Parameter wasn't adjusted, the result looks horrible.  (It looks like art tho.)

### symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization
Only implemented MUR for solving nmf. Still looking for the reason why it looks bad.
